PowerCouple was developed while travelling from London to Cologne using a double-decker bus - a feat easier imagined than executed. We had 72 hours to start a new business, and pitch our ideas, in competition with 80 other startups. We were featured in the most read business magazine in Europe, <a href="http://businesslife.ba.com/Ideas/Features/All-aboard-the-startup-bus.html">BA Business Life</a>.

After being the most well received pitch to the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister our team went on to postition second in the European competition. We were offered investment and incubation by Allianz. However we rejected it.
