PowerCouple was developed while travelling from London to Cologne using a double-decker bus - a feat easier imagined than executed. We had 72 hours to start a new business, and pitch our ideas, in competition with 80 other startups. We were featured in the most read business magazine in Europe, <a href="http://businesslife.ba.com/Ideas/Features/All-aboard-the-startup-bus.html">BA Business Life</a>.

PowerCouple was an application designed to help couples achieve goals, and be more adventurous, together. Strengthening relationships and helping people achive more was what inspired us and gelled the team together. PowerCouple started life as an idea on a napkin, and ended up in my list of 'to-dos'. Thanks to the attitude in [Building a Web App in 24 Hours and Sleeping]({% post_url 2015-08-08-building-a-web-app-in-24-hours %}) it was given a new life, with a minimum viable prototype and hybrid mobile in 48 hours.

After being the most well received pitch to the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister our team went on to postition second overall in the European competition. We were offered investment and incubation by Allianz, that we decided to turn down. 

As one of the leading Startup Bus contenders we also were entered into several further rounds of pitches at [Pirate Summit](http://piratesummit.com) in Cologne on the main event stage in which we again peformed as one of the top two pitches.
