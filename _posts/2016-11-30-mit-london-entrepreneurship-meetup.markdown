You have an idea for a product, but do you know who will want to buy it? Many seemingly great ideas and technologies come to a sudden halt in the face of one simple, inescapable question. “Who is your customer?”. I chaired and organized this [first sold-out event](
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mit-global-entrepreneurship-london-who-is-your-customer-1-of-3-tickets-28761932715#) in a three part series on Disciplined Entrepreneurship.

Most entrepreneurship events in London are "boring lectures" as one participant, an MIT Biology graduate, put it. This event took attendees out into the wild for the opportunity to learn directly from their customer, based upon their geniune desire and curiousity to learn more about each other.
