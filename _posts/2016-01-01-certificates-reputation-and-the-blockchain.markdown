In 2015 the MIT Media Lab started issuing digital certificates to groups within the Media Lab community. In Q1-Q2 2016 I'll be working with both MIT ODL and the [Media Lab Learning Initiative](http://learn.media.mit.edu/) to issue certificates for former and future attendees of the [MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp](http://bootcmap.mit.edu). With a long term potential to provide digital, independently verifiable, certificates on the blockchain to those who take MIT's MOOCs.

Will be updating as the project progresses. See the [medium article](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f) from Philipp Schmidt for an overview of the project.
