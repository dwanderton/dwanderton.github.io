In 2015 the MIT Media Lab started issuing digital certificates to groups within the Media Lab community. At the start of 2016 I worked with both MIT ODL and the [Media Lab Learning Initiative](http://learn.media.mit.edu/) to issue certificates for former and future attendees of the [MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp](http://bootcmap.mit.edu). With a long term goal to provide digital, independently verifiable, certificates on the blockchain to those who take MIT's MOOCs. By late 2016 close to 150 certificates had been issued from [http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/](http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/).

See the [medium article](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f) from Philipp Schmidt for an overview of the project.
