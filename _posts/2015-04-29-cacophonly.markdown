[Cacophonly](https://cacophonly.com/) was an experiment to see how users would respond to the possibility of making and moderating annoymous statements. As a user types a hashtag they are presented with other statements that have used similar hashtags - in order to stimulate a 'debate at a distance'. You only interact with emotive statements that are relevant to your entered hashtags so noise is limited to your perceived interest.

The site is built with jQuery and Firebase, maintaining a score on all statements based upon their emotive impact with an adjusment for time past.
