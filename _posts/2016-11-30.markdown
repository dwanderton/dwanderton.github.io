I was invited to judge applicants to MIT's Accelerate competition which is the second contest of the MIT $100K. The purpose is prototyping your idea. Twenty semi-finalists will have a small budget, access to industry experts, and a dedicated month over January to test the idea's manifestation into a product or service.
