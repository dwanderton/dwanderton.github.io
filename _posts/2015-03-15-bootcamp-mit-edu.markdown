After a groundbreaking inaugural MIT Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, the decision was made to move from an all encompassing subscription service to a custom constructed platform for both marketing the Bootcamp and receiving applications.

The platform, now in version 2.0, is built using Angular.JS, Bootstrap and a backend in Google Apps Script - meaning that changing the content on the site is as simple as altering a cell on a spreadsheet. Applications are uploaded to Google Drive directly with each applicant being added to a list of applicants spreadsheet.
