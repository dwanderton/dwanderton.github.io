AngelRaise is a platform that allows businesses to increase their survey response rates by donating to a charitable cause each time their surveys get answered. Nonprofits raise funds faster, respondents make an impact and businesses get the customer data they need. We are currently in alpha. I am one of the two co-founders of AngelRaise.

More news to come :)! Watch this space closely!
