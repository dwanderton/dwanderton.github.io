For a couple years now accounting has been a once a year marathon, or should I say more appropriately Iron Man. I'm good at keeping receipts, or 'Source Documentation' as the cool kids like to refer to it. Problem is thats about as far as it gets, and when I look back at the humongous pile of receipts and invoices I very quickly feel like getting a cup of tea, taking that adventerous walk I never got around to, or even climbing a mountain (just not the one made of receipts).

By far the worst feeling, when you know you should have a bit more process in place is when you finally start typing up your receipts only to find that the text has vanished!!! All you are left with is a blank rectangle with not even an indentation of the amount it used to show. If you are lucky perhaps you will have some brand printing to let you know the place of origination, but its little comfort as now its unusable. Totally. I even added my own two cents on the matter on [Law Stack Exchange][law-stack-exchange].

I've collated a collection of key concerns, adapted from [this][sa-acca] Student Accountant article from the ACCA. Why? I've been key to build an accounting process that is straight forward, yet audit worthy. Quick, but able to provide detailed information for management accounting.

While designing your process you should consider that each of the concerns below should be addressed by our accounting process. This will put us well on our way to ensuring that any and all transactions are appropriately and accurately accounted for.

**Completeness**
All transactions have been recorded in  financial statements – ie all assets, liabilities, equity interests (capital and reserves) and other disclosures have been included in the financial statements. 

**Occurrence**
Transactions, events and other matters that have been recorded actually took place – and relate to your organisation.

**Valuation and allocation**
All items have been included in the financial statements at appropriate amounts according to company policy and the relevant financial reporting framework. 

**Classification and understandability**
Financial information is appropriately presented and disclosed, and disclosures are clearly expressed so as to make them understandable to the users. For this, the disclosures should use simple language and state matters clearly and concisely. 

**Accuracy**
Accuracy means that amounts and other data relating to transactions and events have been recorded at the correct amounts – ie at the amounts appearing in the source documents. 

**Rights and obligations**
This means that the entity has a right to its assets – ie it is free to use or dispose of the assets as it sees fit. Furthermore, the entity is obliged to pay off the liabilities that are shown in the statement of financial position. 

**Existence** 
This means that assets, liabilities and equity interests (capital and reserves) are physically present/belong to the entity on the reporting date. 

**Cutoff**
This means that transactions and events have been recorded in the correct accounting period – for example, if goods are delivered prior to year end, they are included in the cost of goods sold, not inventory.
